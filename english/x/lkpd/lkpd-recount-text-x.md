**My First Day at Senior High School**

Last Monday was my first day at MAN 1 Kota Bima. I woke up very early because I was nervous and excited at the same time. My mother had prepared my new uniform the night before.

I arrived at school at 6:30 AM. The school looked bigger than my junior high school. There were many new students like me standing in the schoolyard. We all looked confused and worried.

First, we had an orientation program in the main hall. The principal welcomed us and explained the school rules. Then, the teachers introduced themselves one by one. After that, we were divided into different classes.

My homeroom teacher, Mrs. Sari, was very kind. She helped us find our classroom and introduced us to each other. We played some ice-breaking games to get to know our new classmates.

During the break time, I met Ahmad, a friendly boy from my neighborhood. We had lunch together in the school canteen. The food was delicious and not expensive.

In the afternoon, we had a school tour. We visited the library, laboratory, and sports facilities. Everything was well-equipped and modern.

When the school day ended, I felt much better. I realized that starting senior high school wasn't as scary as I thought. I was looking forward to the next day and making new friends.
