**Teacher's Notes:** 
This LKPD is designed to provide comprehensive practice in all language skills related to procedure texts. Students should complete this after the introductory lesson to reinforce understanding of text structure, practice following and giving instructions, and develop their ability to write clear procedural texts. The activities progress from receptive skills (listening/reading) to productive skills (speaking/writing) to ensure scaffolded learning.
