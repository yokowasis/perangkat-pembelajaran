### **Reading Text 1: Advanced Recipe Analysis**

**Homemade Sourdough Bread**

**Goal:** To create artisanal sourdough bread with perfect texture and flavor

**Materials:**
- 500g bread flour (high protein content recommended)
- 350ml lukewarm water (filtered preferred)
- 100g active sourdough starter
- 10g sea salt
- Digital kitchen scale (essential for accuracy)
- Large mixing bowl
- Kitchen thermometer
- Banneton basket or bowl lined with cloth
- Dutch oven or baking stone

**Method:**
1. **Autolyse (30 minutes):** Combine flour and water in a large bowl. Mix until no dry flour remains. This process allows the flour to fully hydrate and begins gluten development. Cover and rest at room temperature.

2. **Mixing (10 minutes):** Add the active starter to the autolyse mixture. Mix thoroughly using your hands or a dough scraper. The starter should be doubled in size and pass the float test before use.

3. **Salt incorporation (5 minutes):** Sprinkle salt evenly over the dough. Using wet hands, mix until the salt is completely incorporated. The dough will become slightly more cohesive.

4. **Bulk fermentation (4-6 hours):** Perform 4 sets of stretch and folds at 30-minute intervals during the first 2 hours. The dough should increase in size by 50-70% and feel jiggly when shaken.

5. **Pre-shaping (30 minutes):** Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Shape into a round and let rest, covered with a damp cloth.

6. **Final shaping:** Shape the dough into a boule or batard. Place seam-side up in a banneton basket lined with rice flour.

7. **Final proof (2-4 hours or overnight in refrigerator):** The dough is ready when it passes the poke test - a gentle finger press should spring back slowly.

8. **Baking preparation:** Preheat Dutch oven to 250°C (480°F) for at least 30 minutes.

9. **Scoring and baking:** Turn dough onto parchment paper, score with a sharp blade, and bake covered for 20 minutes, then uncovered for 20-25 minutes until golden brown.

10. **Cooling:** Cool completely on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before slicing to allow the crumb to set properly.

**Critical Analysis Questions:**

1. **Text Structure Analysis:**
   - Identify and explain the purpose of each section in this procedure text
   - How does this structure differ from simple recipe formats?
   - What makes this a "complex" procedure text?

2. **Language Features Analysis:**
   - Find examples of technical terminology and explain their importance
   - Identify temporal connectives and analyze their sophistication level
   - Locate passive voice constructions and explain their function

3. **Process Evaluation:**
   - Which steps require the most precision and why?
   - Identify potential failure points in this process
   - Suggest improvements or alternative methods for beginners

4. **Scientific Reasoning:**
   - Explain the scientific principles behind the "autolyse" process
   - Why is temperature control critical in this procedure?
   - How do the timing variations affect the final product?

### **Reading Text 2: Technical Manual Extract**

**Smartphone Battery Optimization Procedure**

**Objective:** Maximize battery life and performance through systematic optimization

**Prerequisites:**
- Smartphone with Android 10+ or iOS 13+
- Access to device settings
- Understanding of app permissions
- 30 minutes of uninterrupted time

**Phase 1: Initial Assessment (5 minutes)**
Navigate to Settings > Battery > Battery Usage to analyze current consumption patterns. Document the top 5 battery-consuming applications and their usage percentages. This baseline data will help measure improvement effectiveness.

**Phase 2: Display Optimization (10 minutes)**
Adjust display settings systematically: reduce brightness to 40-60% depending on ambient lighting conditions, enable adaptive brightness for automatic adjustment, set screen timeout to maximum 2 minutes, disable always-on display features if present, and switch to dark mode when available as it significantly reduces power consumption on OLED displays.

**Phase 3: Connectivity Management (8 minutes)**
Optimize wireless connections strategically: disable Wi-Fi scanning when not actively connecting to networks, turn off Bluetooth when not in use, disable mobile hotspot if activated, switch to airplane mode in areas with poor cellular reception to prevent battery drain from signal searching, and disable NFC unless required for payments.

**Phase 4: Application Optimization (10 minutes)**
Review and modify app behaviors: disable background app refresh for non-essential applications, revoke location permissions for apps that don't require it, disable push notifications for non-critical apps, uninstall or disable unused pre-installed applications, and enable battery optimization for all non-system apps through the device's battery settings.

**Phase 5: Advanced Settings (7 minutes)**
Configure system-level optimizations: enable power saving mode when battery drops below 20%, disable vibration for keyboard and system sounds, reduce animation scales in developer options (set to 0.5x), disable Google Assistant's "Hey Google" detection if not frequently used, and schedule automatic system updates during charging periods.

**Verification and Monitoring:**
Monitor battery performance for 48-72 hours after implementation. Expected improvements include 15-25% increase in battery life, reduced charging frequency, and more consistent power consumption patterns. Document any issues and adjust settings accordingly.

**Advanced Analysis Questions:**

1. **Procedure Complexity Assessment:**
   - How does this technical procedure differ from basic instructions?
   - What level of user expertise does this procedure assume?
   - Identify the hierarchical structure of this procedure

2. **Effectiveness Evaluation:**
   - Which optimization phase would likely yield the greatest battery improvement?
   - How could this procedure be adapted for different user types?
   - What additional steps might be necessary for older devices?

3. **Language and Communication Analysis:**
   - Analyze the use of technical jargon versus accessible language
   - How do the time estimates contribute to user experience?
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of the verification section

**Assessment**: Students must demonstrate sophisticated analytical skills by correctly answering 8 out of 10 complex comprehension and analysis questions.
