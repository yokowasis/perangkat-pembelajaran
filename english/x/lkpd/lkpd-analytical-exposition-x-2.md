> **Student 1:** "From my perspective, social media predominantly serves as a distraction. Nevertheless, some argue it has educational benefits."
> **Student 2:** "I advocate for a more balanced view. The underlying issue isn't social media itself, but how students use it."
> **Professor:** "Compelling points. What criterion should we use to evaluate this?"
> **Student 1:** "Consequently, we need research-based evidence rather than assumptions."

**Advanced Questions:**
1. Analyze the professor's perspective on social media. What makes this topic controversial?
2. Compare and contrast the two students' viewpoints. Which argument is more compelling and why?
3. Identify three sophisticated vocabulary words used and explain their meaning in context.

### Reading

**Complex Academic Text: "Digital Technology in Modern Education: A Critical Analysis"**

The integration of digital technology in contemporary educational systems represents one of the most controversial developments in modern pedagogy. From one perspective, advocates argue that technology substantially enhances learning outcomes through personalized instruction and interactive engagement. Nevertheless, critics contend that excessive reliance on digital tools undermines traditional learning methods and social interaction skills.

Research conducted by educational psychologists reveals compelling evidence supporting both viewpoints. Technology proponents cite studies demonstrating that students using adaptive learning software show predominantly positive academic gains. The underlying criterion for success appears to be the quality of implementation rather than the technology itself.

Consequently, educational institutions face the substantial challenge of determining appropriate technology integration levels. The most compelling approach involves establishing clear criteria for technology use based on pedagogical effectiveness rather than novelty. Nevertheless, the controversial nature of this topic suggests that ongoing research and balanced perspectives will be essential for future educational policy development.

**Analytical Questions:**
1. **Main Argument Analysis:** What is the author's central thesis regarding digital technology in education? Support your answer with specific textual evidence.
2. **Perspective Evaluation:** Compare the advocates' and critics' viewpoints. Which perspective does the author find more compelling and why?
3. **Evidence Assessment:** Analyze the quality and reliability of the evidence presented. What makes the research "compelling" according to the author?
4. **Critical Thinking:** What underlying assumptions does the author make about educational effectiveness? Do you agree with these assumptions?
5. **Synthesis:** Based on this text, what criteria should educational institutions use when implementing technology? Justify your reasoning.

**Assessment** : Demonstrate sophisticated text analysis, critical evaluation skills, and ability to synthesize complex information
