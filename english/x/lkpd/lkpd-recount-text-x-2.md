### **Reading Text 1**

**My First Day at a New School**

Three years ago, I faced one of the most challenging days of my teenage life. My family had just moved to Jakarta, and I was starting at a completely new school. Initially, I felt overwhelmed by the size of the building and the crowds of unfamiliar faces.

As I walked through the corridors that first morning, my heart was pounding with anxiety. Unfortunately, I couldn't find my classroom and was already ten minutes late. Eventually, a kind teacher noticed my confusion and guided me to the right place. When I entered the classroom, everyone turned to stare at me, and I felt my face burning with embarrassment.

However, my teacher, Mrs. Sari, welcomed me warmly and introduced me to the class. Subsequently, she assigned a friendly student named Maya to be my buddy for the first week. Maya immediately made me feel at ease by sharing her lunch with me and explaining the school rules.

By the end of the day, I had made three new friends and felt much more confident. Looking back now, I realize that this experience taught me that new beginnings, although scary, often lead to wonderful opportunities.

**Analysis Questions:**

1. What is the main event this recount focuses on?
2. Trace the writer's emotional journey throughout the day.
3. Identify five time connectives used in the text.
4. How does the writer organize the events (chronological, thematic, etc.)?
5. What message or lesson does the writer share in the conclusion?
6. Find examples of how the writer shows emotions rather than just stating them.

### **Reading Text 2**

**The Day Everything Went Wrong**

It was supposed to be the perfect day for our family picnic, but unfortunately, everything that could go wrong did go wrong. We had planned to visit Taman Mini Indonesia Indah early on Saturday morning.

Initially, we woke up to heavy rain, which was completely unexpected since the weather forecast had predicted sunshine. Nevertheless, we decided to wait, hoping it would clear up. Meanwhile, my mother discovered that the sandwiches she had prepared the night before had somehow gone bad in the refrigerator.

Subsequently, when the rain finally stopped around noon, we hurriedly packed new food and headed out. However, our car broke down just as we were leaving our neighborhood. Fortunately, my uncle lived nearby and offered to drive us, but his car could only fit four people, so my grandmother had to stay home.

When we finally arrived at Taman Mini at 3 PM, we found that most of the outdoor attractions were closed due to the earlier rain. Despite all these setbacks, we made the best of the situation by visiting the indoor museums and enjoying some traditional snacks.

Surprisingly, we ended up having a wonderful time together, and this chaotic day became one of our most memorable family stories that we still laugh about today.

**Comprehension Questions:**

1. List all the problems that occurred on this day.
2. How did the family solve each problem?
3. What was the unexpected positive outcome?
4. Find three examples of contrast connectives (but, however, despite, etc.).
5. Why does the writer call this day "memorable" despite all the problems?

**Assessment**: Students must demonstrate sophisticated comprehension by analyzing narrative structure, identifying language features, and understanding implied meanings.
