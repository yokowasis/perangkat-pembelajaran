### Reading

**Complex Literary Text: "The Necklace" by Guy de Maupassant (Excerpt)**

Mathilde Loisel was born into a family of clerks, and married a minor civil servant. She suffered constantly, feeling herself born for every delicacy and luxury. The poverty of her apartment tortured her; she dreamed of reception-halls hung with oriental tapestries and lighted by bronze candelabra.

When her husband secured an invitation to an elegant ministry ball, instead of joy, Mathilde felt only distress. "I have nothing to wear," she complained. Her devoted husband sacrificed his savings to purchase her a gown. Yet still she remained dissatisfied.

"I shall look absolutely impoverished without jewels," she declared. Her friend, Madame Forestier, graciously loaned her a stunning diamond necklace. At the ball, Mathilde was the most beautiful woman present, elegant, gracious, and intoxicatingly happy.

The catastrophe struck upon their return: the necklace had vanished. For ten devastating years, the Loisels labored to repay the enormous debt incurred replacing what they believed was an invaluable diamond necklace, only to discover that the original had been mere paste—worth virtually nothing.

**Advanced Literary Analysis:**

1. **Character Psychology:** Analyze Mathilde's character development. How do her values and desires drive the plot? What personality flaws lead to her downfall?

2. **Irony and Foreshadowing:** Identify examples of dramatic irony and foreshadowing in this excerpt. How does Maupassant prepare readers for the tragic revelation?

3. **Social Commentary:** What critique of 19th-century society and materialism does this story present? How does Mathilde represent broader social issues?

4. **Symbolism and Theme:** Analyze the necklace as a symbol. What does it represent about appearance versus reality, social status, and human nature?

5. **Narrative Technique:** Evaluate the effectiveness of the third-person omniscient narrator. How does this perspective enhance the story's impact?

**Assessment** : Demonstrate sophisticated literary analysis, cultural understanding, and critical evaluation of complex themes
