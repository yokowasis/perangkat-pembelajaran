### Reading

**Text: Should Students Learn Cooking in School?**

I believe that students should learn cooking in school. First, cooking is an important life skill. Many young people cannot cook basic meals when they leave home. Furthermore, learning to cook helps students understand nutrition and healthy eating habits.

However, some people argue that schools should focus on academic subjects. They think cooking takes time away from math and science. 

In my opinion, cooking combines many skills. Students learn math when they measure ingredients. They learn science when they understand how heat changes food. Therefore, cooking education supports academic learning.

In conclusion, schools should teach cooking because it gives students practical skills for life and supports their academic development.

**Questions:**
1. What is the writer's main opinion? ________________________________

   a. _________________________________________________________
   b. _________________________________________________________

4. How does cooking connect to academic subjects? ___________________
5. What is the writer's conclusion? __________________________________

**Assessment** : Answer the main idea question and 3 out of 4 detail questions correctly
